#URL shortner for Umbrella web

To install the app you must do:

#Clone the repo and cd

npm install

#Install mongodb localy
	For Ubuntu just do sudo apt install mongodb
	For macOS do brew install mongodb and make sure that it`s in your $PATH

chmod a+x start.sh
./start.sh

#IMPORTANT!
	Setup script is currently in development so don`t use it.
	I will try my best to make it work across *nix systems
